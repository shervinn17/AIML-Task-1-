# Task 1: AI & ML Project

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `Task_1_AI_&_ML.ipynb` that demonstrates the step-by-step development and evaluation of Machine Learning models using a structured dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Overview

The notebook performs the following key operations:

- **Data Loading:** Importing the dataset and initial exploration  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and outliers  
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features for modeling  
- **Model Building:** Training various ML models such as:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors  
  - Support Vector Machine  
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, confusion matrix, and visualization  
- **Result Interpretation:** Summarizing the performance of different models
